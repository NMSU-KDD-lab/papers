## Incorporating knowledge
1. Russell Stewart, Stefano Ermon: <b>Label-Free Supervision of Neural Networks with Physics and Domain Knowledge</b>. AAAI, 2017. [paper](https://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2017/PreliminaryPapers/12-Stewart-14967.pdf) </br> 
This paper works on training a network (f) mapping from inputs to outputs without requiring direct examples of those outputs. It designs a formularization of loss function (g) and regularization term (R).
